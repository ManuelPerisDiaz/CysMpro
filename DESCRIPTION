Description: Data processing (baseline correction and smoothing) and annotation of native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), bottom-up and top-down mass spectrometry (MS). Based on a particular metal binding protein and MS experiment performed, the software might determine metal-to-protein stoichiometry, identify metal binding sites or analyze metal-coupled folding mechanisms. Briefly, a in silico library for a particular metal binding protein is generated and interrogated against experimental MS data calculating a set of scoring indexes that evaluates the annotation.
